74 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII.

6 ι 8. mortibus, dat. There follows a bntcher’s catalogue. The
Roman taste Cor such descriptions was in part the effect of the
gladiatorial shows.

- 619 sq. lemurum has a strong emphasi& ⁸ who is killed outright.’

uolnus, what wounds, i.e. the weapon‚ cf. vm 384 ⁴ et quo ferre
uelint, permittere uolnera uentis' ι for the use of the abstr- cf. mones
517 n. exierit ‘is launched‚' cf. lv 201 sq. ‘qua lancea dextra!
aierit) calcet, in his death convulsionS. Ovid Met. 12. 39ο sq. is
much worse than Lucan.

621 sq. ‘Who with the ontrush of his life drove out the sword
buried in his throat as he faced the foe! An incredible occurrence which
is frequently mentioned3 111 599 sq. ‘ utrasque simul largus crwr expulit
hastas Ι diuisitque animam’3 Ον. Met. 13. 393 sq. ‘nec ualuere manus
infixum educere telum 3 Ι expulit spsecruor’3 Senec- Oed. 1064 ‘firmmque
secum nimius eiecit emor-³ amma (Crit. App.) ‘life-blood,' as
111 640 sq. ‘discursusque animae diuersa in membra meantis Ι inter·
ceptus aquis’ 3 Virg. Aen. 9. 349. The Stoics regarded the soul (anima)
as fed by vapours from the blood, Zeller Stoics &a

623. membra, here ‘arms,' so seemingly 111 431 ‘in sua crede·
bant redituras membra secures,’ and probably Prop. 2. 28. 11 ‘an con·
tempta tibi Iunonis membra (templa MSS) Pelasgae Ρ (of λευκώλενος Ἥρη).

624. mamittmt ‘let the missiles pass through,' cf. Sil. It. 2. 1 18
‘calamumque uolantem, Ι dum clamat, patulo excipiens transmisit hiatu.'

625. qula e scissia, Crit. App. perruperat. Cf. the simile in
Ov. Met. 4. 121 sqq. ‘cruor emicat alte Ι non aliter quarn cum uitiato
fistula plumbo Ι scinditur et tenues stridente foramine longe Ι eiaculatur
aquas, atque ictibus aera rumpit.’

626. ‚hostia Η. well quotes Lucr. 4. 1049 sqq. ‘namque omnes

plerumque cadunt in uolnus, et illam Ι emicat in partem sanguiS‚ unde ·

icimur ictu; Ι et, si comminus est, hostem ruber occupat umor.'
8111 refers to the real subject quis, not to cruors ς so in other similar
cases, e.g. Prop. 3. 9. 56 ‘Antonique graues in sua fata manus.’

627. ut nomm ponat. This, as well as the next sentence, is quite
inconsistent with any idea that they would be rewarded for killing
relations, as inputet is explained by some in 325, see n. The actions
mentioned here are concessions to the feeling which Caesar would there
be made to outrage.

631. nullon hominum, no individuals in the throng. The gen.
compels us to think of them separately. nummus ‘have space,’ cf.
11 118sq. ‘cui funera uolgi Ι flere καθ’
