independent commands¹; but the chief conduct of the war
remained with Pompey. The forces now at his disposal were
on paper most imposing. The legionary soldiers were more
than twice as numerous as Caesar’s, while the cavalry out-
numbered his sevenfold ². Besides there were over 4‚000 slingers
and bowmen⁸, and a prodigious horde of auxiliaries. N ever
had a Roman commander brought such a vast and multifarious
army into the field ; and our poet may well be forgiven the
hyperbole of calling it a world in arms⁴. Of the regular troops,
five legions had crossed with Pompey from Italy⁵; another was
composed of veterans who had settled in Crete and Macedonia
who had volunteered for service (euocati), another was from
Cilicia⁶, two came from the province of Asia under the com-

¹ Compare the words of Caesar c. 82. 1 ‘suum cum Scipione honorem
partitur classicumque apud eum cani et alterum illi iubet praetorium
tendi.’

² 117 cohorts or 48‚000 men and 2000 veterans of the reserve
(euocati) as against 75 cohorts or 24‚000: 7‚000 cavalry as against
1000.

surrendered to the Senate. ⁵

⁶ The Mss of Caesar B. C. 3. 4. 1 have ‘ex Sicinass which does not
agree with 3. 88. 3 ‘ Ciliciensis legio-⁹ The emendation of Ciacconius
Cilicia is confirmed by the circumstance that the legion was called gemella
by Pompey bemuse it was made out of two, and we know from ad Att.
5. 15. 1 that the force which Cicero had at his disposal when governor
of Cilicia 50—49 B.c. consisted of two attenuated legions, Against this
it has been urged that Lucan says (‘agmina quae Cilicum terris deducta
tenebat Ι Scipio,’ απ) that these Cilician forces came with Scipio.
There is however no reason for thus pressing words which must refer
primarily to the Syrian legions (above p. xv, n. α), and Lucan’s mention
of Cilicia is quite justified by the circumstance that the operations
(detrimentis as Caesar sarcastically calls them), in virtue of which
Scipio assumed the title of imperator, took place about Mount Amanus.
Moreover, even a definite statement of Lucan would have little weight
against such a coincidence as we have pointed out.
