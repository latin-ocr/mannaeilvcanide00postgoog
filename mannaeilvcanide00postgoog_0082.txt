aerium niuei montis liquere cacumen’ ς Hor. Serm. 1. 3. 9sqq. ‘ saepe
uelut qui Ι currebat fugiens hostem, persaepe uelut qui Ι Iunonis sacra
ferret) So in Pind. Nem. 8. 4osqq.¹ αὔξεται δ’ ἀρετὰ χλωραῖς ἐέρσαις ὡς
ὅτε δένδρεον ᾄσσει Ι ἐν σοφοῖς ἀνδρῶν deposed ἐν δικαίοις τε Ι πρὸς

64 sq. δελφῖνί κεν τάχος δι’ ἅλμας Ι ἰσώσαιμι (30 we should read, ἴσον
εἴποιμι codd.) Μελησίαν, δι’ ἅλμας belongs only to the delphin.

‘inactive’ expl. by arte relicta ‘abandoning his craft’ xor ‘ profession‚’
here the ars gubernandi (Cia, Quintil.) 01· navigation. So iners
is properly a man who has no profession.

, 127. onus, 110 13 111010 ‘freight'; onus (cf. onera, onemn’a) is a
regular. word for ⁸ eergo?

128. animi truces ‘even bold spirits? animus the heart’s action,
cf. ιν 285 sqq. ‘ saucia maiores animos ut pectora gestant Ι (111111 dolor oet
ictusque recens’ (cf. 290), 1.0. ‘there is more vitality -111 the heart.' It
could hardly mean the ltearts themselves. For the strong emphasis on
truces· cf. notes ou 241, 280, 711, ι760. pulsant. Cf. Il. 2. 716
θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι πάτασσε.

129. imerus ‘irregulas,' a bad sign. H. quotes Aesch. Ag. 995—
. 130. mortu. The Schol. quotes pallida neme fictura Virg. Aen.
4. 644 and the idea is common elsewhere. Cf. Macaulay, Hist. qf
England 011. v, 011 Μο11111011111 before Sedgmoor ‘The very children who
pressed to see him pass observed and long remembered that his look
was· sad and sun of evil augury.’ The last words mean ‘their appearance

'qum esset ⁴ what it is to be,’ 1.0. whether a regnum or a libera
ciuitas. The imperf. indicates a time future to that os conderet. The
ambiguity is usually avoided in prose by using the periphrastic future
‘quid sutura esset' (N. L. P. †232); but not always, cf. Livy 2. 55. 9,
‘incerti quatenus Volero exerceret uictoriam,’ and other places.
