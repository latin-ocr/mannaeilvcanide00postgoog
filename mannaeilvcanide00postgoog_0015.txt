X HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

to anticipa-te the Ides of Marchl. lt need hardly be said that
the orations put in the mouths of Caesar, Pompey and others
are fictitious when it is known that even professed historians
would have been thought but poor masters of their art, if
they had recorded instead of inventing the speeches of their
characters&

Secondly, Lucan's poem was written with an object, whose
nature he does not disguise from his readers, the glorification of
the cause which was lost at Pharsalia-3. And he seldom loses
an opportunity of colouring and distorting events in the interests
of the optimates and their leader. The luxury of the Pompeians
is erased from the picture to make way for the rapacity of the
Caesarians4. The collapse of Pompey after the defeat of his
horse is covered up with rhetorical gloss· The laudation of the

expedient. The oblique narration was used sor these imaginary exercises‚

Justin 38. 3 fin„ who blames Livy and Sallust for disregarding this
convention.

⁴ 1t is curious to note how Lucan has dealt with the incidents of the
scene of luxury in the Pompeian camp (see below, p. xxxi). The
turf on which the ‘unspeakable’ Caesarians sleep has been cut for the
kings (762). The gold and silver of which they make prize were sor
the expenses qfthe war (753).
