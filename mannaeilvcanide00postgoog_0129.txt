aestus per utraque castra omnium sere corpora mouit' ς of the mind
Ov. Tr. 5. 6. 24 ‘ut mea sit longis mens quoque mota malis? For
the sense compare Milton Paradise Lost bk. x ‘So saying with
delight he snuff'd the smell Ι Of mortal change on earth.' cada-
uere, 598 n.

832. The cranes—birds which do not eat carrion—were this year
later in migrating from Thrace to Egypt. Their migration is alluded to
v 711 sqq. Cf. Shelley Hellas, ‘As multitudinous on the ocean line Ι
As cranes upon the cloudless leracian windss

834. tant-o uoltum seems to· be an expression like multa auis,
which means not ‘many a bird ' (distributive), but ‘plenty of birds’
(collective), as multa rosa means a ‘bed of rose-leaveS‚' so that we
might translate ‘never did the sky clothe itself so thickly with vultures!
But, as Lucan frequently puts singular for plural (cf. 102 n.), it differs
little from ‘so many vultures-⁹ ⁸
Α 835. induit. For the metaphor cf. Claud. Phoenix (c. min. 27) 77
‘exercitus ingens (alituum) Ι obnubit uario late connexa meatu.’ He has
used the same metaphor twice before 538, 819.

837. aute (cs. uolture 834)...rorlbus, a good instance of the
way in which ablatives are sometimes accumulated in Latin in slightly
different senses; the first one is nearly equivalent to per with the acc.
For the phrase, which appears to be> from Virg. Aen. 12. 339 sq.
‘spargit rapida ungula rores 1 sanguineos’ (cf. 8. 645 ‘rorabant sanguine
uepres ’) compare tx'698 ‘ dirosque fero de sanguine rores-⁸

838. uictoris, the victorious army, cf. 758 n.

841. peruemt ad ossa ‘was reduced to bones,’ cf. Varro R. R.

of pods)

842. abst with ln feras, ⁸ passed into beasts.'

843. auide. Cf. ‘auide desaeuit’ vt 540, ‘auide petitis' lv 445.

844. degustant ‘taste of,' cf. tx 287 sq. (of bees tasting flowers)
‘nec iam degustat amarum Ι desidiosa thymum’; of a slight scratch‚ Virg.
Aen. 12. 376 ‘summum degustat uolnere corpus-⁹ Lafflae, cf. 4oon.

845. mmbt‘rain.'

846. long-tor, the comparative differs little from the positive, but
appears to mark impatience, vlu 27 ‘longius aeuum Ι destruit ingentis
animos,' ‘unduly protracted.’ resolutam, broken up ‚into its com-
ponents; cf. Lucr. 2. 62 sq. ‘quomotu genitalia materiai Ι corpora res
uarias gignant genitasque resoluunt!
