NOTES. 69

the Britanni Hor. carm. t. 35. 29 sq. ‘ultimos Ι orbis Britannos‚’ to the
title ‘ furthest in the world,’ as they are as far to the west, and Gades is
the sun’s conch, Stat. Sila. 3. 1. 183.

543. luc ‘they (lit. this) will be the Roman people.' 1t is difficult
to set any limits to the so·called attraction os pronouns to the predicate,
cf. Prop. a. 24. 5ο sq. ⁸ uix uenit extremo qui legat ossa die. Ι hi tibi* nos
erimus.'

544. fatis. ‘The fates were allowed free course for Caesar.' Though
destiny cannot be altered (except perhaps in minor respects‚ see the
remarkable passage on the power of the Thessalian witches beginning
‘si sata minora moueres’ VI 605 sqq.), yet its course can be arrested,
111 392 ‘quantum est quod fata tenentur! ’ (cf. 88, 295) or accelerated,
v 41 ⁸ fatorum impellite cursum ’ (cf. 52). See also Mr Heitland's
examples pp. 44 sq. Consistency in speaking of fate is as difficult to
the world in general as correctness in referring to the earth’s motion
round its axis and for much the same reason. The Stoics certainly did
not succeed in their attempt to reconcile their doctrine of N ecessity with
the popular conception of the freedom of the individual will; see Zeller
Stoics &a (Eng- Tr. p. 178).

545. Lucan follows the conquering Caesarians to the centre.

robur, 221. .

546 sq. ‘The fight (ι 12 n.), which had spread its wanden-ing course

over all the wide plain, stopped here and Caesar’s fortune was checked.’

errore has its strict verbal sense. The metaphor appears to be
from a river in flood. haesit, cf. ‘haas-erunt ibi sata diu,' 111 645.
Η. cf. Virg. Aen. 11. ⁴²90·

548. mic. Observe the change of pronoun. He returns to hic in
551, cf. also ²29 sqq. auxum, the abl. will be used somewhat
differently, according as we make the noun mean ‘help ' (plur. because
regum is plur.) or ‘ auxiliary forces)

549. renumque. Τὴε negative, as osten in Lucan, is carried on
from the previous clause. neque (or aut) would be used in prose, cf.
Heitl. Introd. p. 108 (β). mouere, cf. notes on 494, 767.

rocam, cf. lv α 33 sq. ‘ Magne, paras acies mundique extrema
tenentes Ι sollicitas reges?

551. tua elimina ‘the proofs of your guilt'; cf. rx 1090 sq. ‘sed
non, ut crimina solum Ι uestra tegat telluS, iusto date tura sepulcro ’
(of Pompey's murdered body).

553. uate with the gen., cf. Ov. Am. 3. 9. 5 ‘ ille tui uates operis)

555. The sense iar let a patriot’sfeeling be condemned to silenceg
