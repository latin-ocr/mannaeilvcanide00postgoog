ADDEN DUM.

462—3. 1 am glad to find myself to a certain extent in agreement
with C. M. Francken Mnemosyne (n. series), vol. 22 p. 166, who reads
‘inde manus spectant uoltusque ac noscere quaerunt‚’ comparing for the
corruption 11 193 where M reads ac noscendus for agnoscendus. He
places 462 before 463, in which he reads ‘quo sua pila cadant et quae
sibi fata minentur.’ The sense thus obtained is a very fair one: but it
may be doubted whether the MS variants can be thus explained 3 and
the preponderance of evidence, as already said, is in favour of a different
order of lineS.
