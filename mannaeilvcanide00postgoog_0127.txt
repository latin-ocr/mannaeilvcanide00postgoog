84 LVCANI DE BELLo CIVILI Lm. vn.

(supra), of the piles of slain. This is made clear by succensae, cf.
Livy 45. 33. α ‘subdita sace succendit.' For the facts see Introd.
p. xxxiv, n. 3.

801. in hoste (Crit. App.), cf. Prop. 3 (4). 19. 28 ‘uictor erat
quamuis, aequus -in hoste fuit.’

803. cinea, so more obnoxious than hostes. The violence of
civil animosity has been ¹oft-en shown in history, as in the feuds of
Corcyra and in the ferocious language of Vitellius, which H. quotes, Suet.
Vit. 10 ‘optime olere occisum hostem, et melius ciuem!

805. non interpositas, generally interpreted (after the Schol.
‘separatis ⁹) ‘with no gaps between them? As this inverts the verb's
meaning, it is best to explain it of bodies so closely packed on a single
pile that no flames can pass between them.

806. aut etc„ if you act thus to pain your son-in-law, there is
a more effectual way of doing it. nemus ‘the felled timber,'
cf. Sen. Herc. Fur. 122 3 ‘structum aceruans nemore congesto aggerem.'

810. receptat, cf. Lucr. quoted on 818.

811. ubi debent, i.e. have in them the seeds of their own

decgyth. usserit. Τ110 fut. perf. means ‘though you effect your

purpose now.’ ‚

814. communis rogus, when the world is destroyed by fire. The
periodical destruction of the world by fire (ἐκπύρωσις) οι· by water was
held by Seneca, as by most Stoics‚ though when the agent would be
fire and when water, was not actually determined. BerosuS, quoted by
Seneca, Nat. Quaest. 3. 29. 1, held that the universal conflagration
would take place when all the planets were in the same straight line
in the sign of Cancer, and the universal deluge when that sign was
Capricorn. See also 135 n. ossibus aetra mixturas. So v 636
‘ nox manes mixtura dns-2

815. tuam. The subst. animam is anticipated from the next
line; sor a somewhat similar anticipation cf. 20 n.

816. eunt, see Crit. App. and 1¹4 n. The sense is ‘whatever the
destination of your spirit, some of these spirits will be there with you.⁸
Lucan has of course no doubt of Caesar's destination. ibis ln
auras. The Stoics believed that the souls of the good, after undergoing
a purgation, rose into the ether where they assumed a spherical shape
like the stars'; hence Pompey's umbra ‘aeternos animam collaeit in
orbes’ (1x 9). Lucan (1.0. 5 sq.) fixes as the place ‘qua niger astriferis
conectitur axibus aer Ι quaque patet terras inter lunaeque meatus,' cs.
