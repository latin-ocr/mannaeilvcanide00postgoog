xxvi HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

men, to guard the camp¹‚ Caesar then entered the field with
eighty cohortS, that is eight legions consisting of about 22‚ooo
men. In addition to the legionaries he had 1,ooo horse and
some auxiliary troops: Appian mentions besides Gallie cavalry,
a number of Transalpine GauIS, and a force of Greek peltasts
from Dolopia, Acarnania and Aetolia. His legionaries he drew
up in the usual three lines. On the right wing‚ commanded by
P. Cornelius Sulla, he placed the famous tenth legion3 on the
left wing‚ commanded by Mark Antony, the ninth, which had
suffered very severely in the fights round Dyrrhachium, and to
which he accordingly joined the eighth legion, giving each
instructions to support the other. The centre was placed under
the command of Caluinus. Caesar himself took up his position
in the right wing‚ thus confronting Pompey. The greater part,
if not the whole, of his cavalry was on the right also, When he
came in sight of the enemy and observed their dispositions„
Caesar at once divined his adversary’s plan. He rapidly
detached one cohort from the third line of each of his legions to
form a ‘ fourth line ' or reserve, and placed them, fronting side-
ways, on his right wing‚ opposite to the enemy's cavalry, but

(c. 75) mentions the number left to guard the tents as 2,ooo of the
oldest soldiers (τοὺς πάνυ γέροντας).

¹ The statement of Lucan (326 n.) and Appian that Caesar ordered
the camp to be dismantled is rightly traversed by Mr B. Perrin and
Col. Stoffel (vol. 11. pp. 20, 247). The former rejects it altogether as a
rhetorical invention ‘in a fictitious speech attributed to Caesar by a
sensational poet.’ The latter supposes it to be based on a real order of
Caesar, wh0‚ sor the sake of expedition, had the gates of the camp
enlarged and breaches made in the uallum, these defences being subse·
quently repaired by the cohorts left in garrison. Against this view
Mr Perrin’s observation (1. c. p. 326), that ‘it would have taken more

time to demolish the walls of a Roman camp than for its occupants to -

march out of the ordinary gates and form in order of battle outside‚’ has
weight. And it is clear from Caesar’s wordS, ‘cum iam esset agmen in
portiS,' that the arrangements for marching out had already been made.
For a way in which the story might have originated see note on 331.
