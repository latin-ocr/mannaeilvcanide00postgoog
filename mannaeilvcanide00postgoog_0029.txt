reached a position suitable for the execution of the manoeuvre
which was to give him the victory. His right wing, under the
command of Lentulus¹‚ rested on a small stream² whose preci·
pitous banks and the swampy ground which it had recently
deluged formed a sufficient protectlon against a flank attackss.
Here were the Cilician legion and the cohorts which Afranius
had brought, from Spain& Except for a small detachment of
600⁶, there were no cavalry on this wing. In the centre were
the steady Syrian legions with Scipio as commander. The left
wing, where Pompey himself commanded in chief, consisted of

³ For the floods see Lucan 224 and note. Compare also the words
of Plutarch just quoted πρὸς ἑλώδεσι χωρίοις.

fused with the light-armed caetrati, 2 32 note.

⁶ According to FrontinuS‚ 500 according to Orosius and Eutropius·
Col. Stoffel perhaps rightly identifies them with the Pontio horse
of Lucan 226. This detachment, which played no part in the battle, is
not mentioned by Caesar quoted in note on 506.
