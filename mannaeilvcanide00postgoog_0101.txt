58 LVCANI DE BELLO 01v1L1 LIB. vn.

385 sq. procurrunt. Cf. Livy 35. 5. a ‘ne certaminis studio
procurrerent priusquam datum signum esset‚’ lv 772 sq. ‘ neque enim
licuit procurrere contra Ι et miscere manus.’ The statement is only true
of the Caesarian line 3 see Introd. p. xxviii. motu irarum ‘tumult of
passion,’ cf. Lucr. ‘irarum fluctus.’ For ira cf. 103 ιι.

387. facient. The sense of damnum must be got out of ‘ex-
pleat—reparet. quidquid, a word of which Lucan is fond, seems
here to be due to a straining after exact expression, ‘ an amount of
mischief which no age can repair, whatever that may be‚' ‘the sull total
that’; cs. vul 179 sqq. ‘quidquid descendet ab arbore summa Ι
Arctophylax propiorque mari Cynosura feretur, Ι in Syriae portus tendet
ratis‚' ‘by the exact amount that Arctophylax sinks below the mast head
—will the ship move towards Syria:

389. ut, concessive. For the punctuation see Crit. App.

390. Pharsalia will be fatal to multitudes yet unbom, who would
have been the children and descendants of the men cut off in that
battle. aem uenientis in orbem, a strange phrase if it means (ι) · the
generation coming into the world’ as we say, and hardly less strange if
it means (α) ‘time revolving in a circle‚' i.e. the whole cycle of ages.
(The doctrine of cycles of time was a Stoic one, Zeller Stoics &a p. 1 16.)
Perhaps Lucan's language was influenced by some reminiscence of the
scene described by Vix-gil Aen. 6. 748—7603 cf. especially the phrase
‘ ubi mille rotam uoluere per annos ’ compared with Silius It. 6. 121 ‘rota
uoluitur aeui.’ In vm 622 sqq. future ages in all parts of the world
are said to watch Pompey's murder ‘saecula Romanos numquam
tacitura labores Ι attendunt aeuumque sequens speculatur ab omni Ι orbe
ratem Phariamque fidem.'

39¹· natale for natali perhaps here only in literature but more than
once on inscriptions. teret ‘carry off,’ Virg. Ecl. 5. 34 ‘te sata
tulerunt?

392. ‘The whole Latin tace will be a name.’ latinum nomon
‘the Latin stock.’ So Caeninum nomen Livy 1. 10, Vols-cum nomen
ib. α. 35, Romanum nomen Ov. Met. 1. 200 etc-3 and in other con-
nexions Virg. Aen. 10. 618 ‘nostra deducit origine nomen' (cf. Τ arquata
nomina, ins. 584 n.). Lucan may have in his mind the nomen Latinum
as distinguished from the socii in the earlier history of Rome3 but see
below. fabula, cf. Pers. 5. 152 ‘cinis et manes etfabulafies.' Ga·
bion, H. quotes Hor. Ep. 1. 11. 7 ‘ Gabiis desertior atque Fidenis.’

Veios. It is somewhat strange to find this Etruscan city,
sor whose overthrow Rome rather than Pharsalia was responsible,
