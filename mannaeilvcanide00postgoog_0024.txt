THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. ΧῙΧ

These indeed did not require the tokens which to pious or de-
sponding spirits conveyed the menace of divine displeasure. A
violent storm opposed the passage of the army into Thessaly.
Day was suddenly turned into night, fire flashed in their faceS‚
and tear-dropS, as it seemed, trickled down the still republican
eaglesl. Upon one of the ensigns a swarm of bees settled, and
its bearer could hardly lift from the ground the overpowering
weight2.

Seven days after the sack of Gomphi Caesar moving eastward
entered the Pharsalian plain, and encamping in a suitable
position awaited the Pompeian advance³. The ripening corn
promised him abundant supplies ; and his troops were in the
highest spirits and condition, all eagerness to face the foe and
wipe out the shameful memory of Dyrrhachium4. Accordingly
when his antagonist, about a week later, marching southward
from Larisa took up a strong position on the hills to the north or

having stayed behind ill at Dyrrhachium3 see Plutarch Cic. 39 init„
compared with Cato min. 55 and Cic. ad Att. 11. 5. 3, and Cicero
himself de Diu. 1. 68, 69. Lucan’s statement that he was the mouth·
piece of the d⁸emand for battle is a rhetorical violation of history
without a particle of justification, unless we draw it from the words of
the periocha of Livy, ‘Cn. Pompeius ad Dyrrhachium obsessus a Caesare
et, praesidiis eius cum magna clade diuersae partis expugnatis, obsidione
liberatus, translato in Thessaliam bello, apud Pharsaliam acie uictus
est. Cicero in castris remansit, uir nihil minus quam ad bella natus‚’
but castris there means the camp near Dyrrhachium, as it is clear from
Cicero’s own phrase (Diu. r. 68) he was not in Dyrrhachium itself.
These last words on Cicero’s peace-loving disposition come at least
in substance from Livy3 and it is worth noting how Lucan twists the
same sentiment to his own purpose (65 sq.).

² See 154, 177, 163 ‘rorantia fletu Ι usque ad Thessaliam Romana et
publica signa ' and notes. It is not difficult to conjecture the con-
nexion between these three phenomena.

⁸ Appian 2. c. 64. Caesar l. c. on 98 note.

⁴ According to Plutarch, Caesar 43, to Caesar’s question, would they
wait for reinforcements? they replied emphatically ‘ N 0.’
