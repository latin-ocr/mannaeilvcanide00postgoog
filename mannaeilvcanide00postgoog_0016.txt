THE BATTLE oF PHARSALIA„ ‘xi

memory3 and facts are hard to hide. The eagerness of the
Caesarians for battle sorts but ill with the length and elaborate-
ness of their leader’s speech ; and when in book vm the flying
hero trembles at every rustle of the forest, we know what to
think of the majestic calm, with which in book v11 he sustains
defeat.

It must not however be supposed that if a narrative of Lucan
cannot be accepted as it standS, it is therefore destitute of all

the command of Caesar for the destruction of his camp seems at
first sight to be as wholly fictitious as it is utterly incredib1e3
but nevertheless it appears to be based on a real incident, and

Even in the absence of all temptation to misstatement the
accuracy of Lucan cannot be relied upon. In every branch of

forces the weapon from the wound3: all of these he had found
in the writings of his predecessors4. In other cases his sub-
