the weight of so many circumstances' which would agree well with
uertens if it could have a neuter sense ‘ rocking' (otherwise nutans or
perhaps uergens which is said to be in some Mss might be read). In
505 Bentley proposed distulit and, unnecessarily, torquente, taking
diu with the main verb. abstinet ‘withholds' would perhaps be
better. sustulit ‘withstood,’ which 1 also proposed, would do if we read
urgentis for ingentis. 509 laeuasque Bentley to make Lucan
agree with Caesar (but see diduxit cornua 506 and note there) and
because saeuas ought not to be applied to Pompeiam, but see 511.
521 frons ibi P. 522 tenet is most obscure. It cannot have
its usual sense ‘keeps in position ' as that would contradict the next line
audit can hardly be interpreted as meaning ‘quas ad id ipsum tenebat!
A verb of moving appears to be required and ciet suggests itself : ciere
is used of moving reserves in Livy 9. 39. 8 ‘ ab ultimis deinde subsidiis
cietur miles! The change is an easy one, and we have observed how often
Lucan’s vocabulary coincides with Livy’s. 530 pubes EVU and
some editors. 532 secutast P originally, the better form, see on
130 above, secuta est the rest. 571 scelerum et BE some edd.
575 contundere all the· Mss but V ς but this verb is not used
for cutting or thrusting. 584 Bentley, whose note subuld be read,
well supports his ingenious conjecture tot tantaque. But the Torquati
follow naturally on the Coruini, a name of similar origin. Lucan
mentions a Torquatus among the Pompeians in v1 285. 587 quid

Mss which all have quod. Mr Heitland prefers quod, understanding
‘how patriotic a weapon l’ 589 Dr Hosius conjectures aeternum,
comparing Virg. Aen. 6. 235. Lucan however alters Virgil while
imitating him (Heitl. p. 110) and extremum seems rhetorically
more effective. 594 humani U and perhaps G1. culmen G,
the later form for columen. premuntur VG, reguntur MBE and
U (but over an erasure), an easier reading. 598 commixta
plebe V²V which direetly contradicts 577. 805 uoluentem V, the
more common word3 but uersantem is supported by Virg. Aen. 11.

625 e sctis-sis ed„ emissis Mss which compels us to take uenis as
‘blood,' a use without example in Lucan or other Classical writers.
