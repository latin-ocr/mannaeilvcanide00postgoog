various meteoric appearances. Senem, Nat. quaest. 7. 4. 4, says that
the trabs ‘praebet speciem ignis extenti’ and ib. 5. a ‘trabes—non
transcurrunt nec praeteruolant ut sacar sed commorantur et in adem
caeli parte conlucent)

156. typhonas (erit. App. ). Lucan appears to reser to the fiery
phenomenon described by Pliny N. Η. a. 91, an awfiil appearance to the
peoples os Ethiopia and Egypt named after Typhon, a king of the
period, ‘ignea specie ac spirae modo intorta, nisu quoque toruo nec
stella uerius quam igneus nodus.’ val? F l. 3. 129 sqq. connects the
appearance with Typhon (that is Typhoeus) the giant imprisoned in
Aetna ⁸ arduus et late fumanti nube coruscus, Ι quantus ubi immenso
prospexit ab aethere Typhon Ι ιζξηε simul uentis-que rubens quem
Juppiter alte Ι crine tenet3 trepidant diro sub lumine puppes? The
last words throw light on Luoen’s somewhat obscure expression,
amdan...aquarnm, the typhon being supposed to suck up the sea. A
writer in Cramer’s Amcd. Vol. 3, p. 406 sq. says they are comets and
continues, in agreement with Pliny, that they are fiery globes, ὡσανεὶ
σύνδεσμοι πυρὸς and that they did not appear in Roman times but
terrified Egypt previously. Joh. Laurent. dc mens. 4. 73, p. 274, writes
Τυφὼν πυρώδης καὶ αἱματώδης φαίνεται καὶ λετ-τούς τινας &tappulam
τλοκαμούς (cf. crine in Val. Fl.). Aristotle de mundo c. 4 however has
τυφών in the sense of a thunderbolt without fire τὸ δ’ ἀστράψαν ἀναπυρωθὲν
βιαίως ἄχρι τῆς γῆς διαθέων κεραυνὸς ahiram—&dv δ’ ἄπυρον ἦ
παντελῶς, τυφών. The interest in meteorology is a feature of Stoicisrn.

157. ingesto in the literal sense corresponding to the metaphorioel
one of 785 n.

158 sq. mata· includes the apices or ridges in which the plumes
were set. solutis ‘ flooded the hilts with the molten blades’ ς cf.
Claud. VI Com. Hon. 344 sqq. ‘ hic tabescente solutus Ι subsedit galea
liquefactaque fulgure cuspis Ι canduit et subitis fluxere vaporibus enses)
But why the hilts? Why were the swords drawn? In similar
circumstances Seneca Ν. ρ. a. 31. 1 speaks of the sheath ‘ manente
uagina gladius ipse liquescit et inuiolato ltgno circa pila ferrum omne
destillat! erepta ‘ struck from their gra-sp!

160. aetherem cf. aether, 154 11. nocens ‘ deadly,’ 60 11.

161. examine ‘swarm' of bees is the only possible sense, as in
Virg. Ecl. 7. 13, Florus 4. a. 45 (os this battle) ‘numquam inminentis
ruinae manifestiora prodigia, fuga uictimarum,· examina in sigyu‘s,
