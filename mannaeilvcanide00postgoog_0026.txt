THE BATTLE OF PHARSALQj ffxxisst
sels was not spared: his inaction was vehemently attacked and
his vanity openly derided. How long was this Agamemnon, this
‘king of kings’1‚ to drag his vassal princes and a submissive
senate at his heels? Procrastination now was not prudence; it
was mere cowardice‚ lust of authority, or worse. If the general
would not light, the soldiers would. Weary of clamour and
apprehensive of the consequences of further delay‚ Pompey
summoned a council of war, announced that he would offer battle
on the morrow, and unfolded his planss. 1t was simplicity itself.
Before the infantry closed, before a single missile had been
discharged on the enemy, the cavalry were to be precipitated
upon their unguarded flank, and Caesa1³s army would be routed.
‘ 1 have communicated this plan‚' he said, ‘to our cavalry and
they have agreed to carr‘y it out³.' He was followed by LabienuS‚
once Caesar’s most trusted officer in the Gallie campaigns, who
declared that Caesar’s soldiers were not the formidable victors
of Gaul and Germany, nearly all of whom had perished in battle
-or by disease, but recent levies from Gallia citerior, and, for the
most part, from the colonies beyond the Padus, He concluded
by taking an oath that he would not return to the camp until the
victory was won and bidding the rest do likewise. Pompey
applauded and swore the same, as did all the other leaders
present. The sequel will show how these oaths were kept.

² So L. Domitius called him. Plutarch Pomp. 67, Caes. 41, Appian
c. 67. The stupid Dio took ‘Agamemnon ’ to be a compliment (42. 5).
2 Plutarch Pomp. 68 represents this council as taking place the day
before the battle ς Caesar c. 86. 1 has the indefinite expression, ‘superio-
ribus diebu3‚’ ‘on a previous day‚’ which however must be interpreted by

the light of ‘ in posterum diem' in ἓ 5, so that there is no contradiction
between Caesar and Plutarch, as Col. Stoffel imagineS, vol. 11. p. 240.

³ ‘ Persuasi equitibus nostris idque mihi facturos confirmauerunt ut,
cum propius sit accessum, dextrum Caesaris cornu ab latere aperto
adgrederentur et circumuenta acie prius perturbatum exercitum‘pellerent
quam a nobis telum in hostem iaceretur,' CaeS. c. 86. Incident and

expression (persuasi) alike throw a vivid light on the weakness of
Pompey's authority.
