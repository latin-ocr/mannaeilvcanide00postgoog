xiv HISTORICAL INTRODU CTION.

5 3. Other authorities.

The only contemporary account of the battle is that in
Caesar's de bello ciuili1. This has to be supplemented by the
accounts of Plutarch (Lives qs Caesar and Pompeius), FloruS‚
Appian ; and brief notices in the epitome of Livy, Velleius

the distinctive features of the engagement are obliterated, and in lien
the feelings of the combatants are described at tedious length in a
washy imitation of Thucydides.

⁸ Owing to the confusion in the Roman calendar and other causes
exact dates in our reckoning cannot be given. In Col. Stoffel's con·

jJectural system this date is May 26, and that of the battle of Pharsalia
une 29.
