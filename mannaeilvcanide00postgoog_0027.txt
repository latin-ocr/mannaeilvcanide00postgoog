In the camp the capitulation of the general to his followers
was received with unbounded exultation, and preparations were
eagerly made for the battle and the adequate celebration of the
victory of which it was to be the mere preliminary. But even
the delirious sels-confidence os Pompey could not close all
the avenues of superstition and anxietyl. His night was a

enemy’s camp swept through the sky and appeared to fall on his

⁵ Plutarch Pomp. l. c. adds that he dreamed besides that he was
decorating the shrine of Venus Victrix with warlike spoils· Venus was
of course the patron divinity of the Julian line and Venus Victrix the
battle-cry of the Caesarians at Pharsalia. That of the Pompeians was
Hercules inuictus, Appian, c. 76 fin.
