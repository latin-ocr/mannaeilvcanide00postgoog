BlUm, et mors uentura est MVGb, U has est at the end of 129. The
variants seem to be best explained by the text. uenturae and st,
the weak form of est, were written as one word in accordance with
the best classical usage3 compare note on 532 below. For the words

which would mean ⁴ is set upright ’ or ‘is elevated ’ (e.g. Livy 1. 27. 8).
For ‘corrigere' cf. Seneca de ira 1. 6. 8 ‘hastilia detorta corrigamuS,’
‘curua corrigere’ Plin. Ep. 5. 21. 6 ‘to set the crooked straight,'
proverbial of a Utopian reformer. The corruption, which appears to
be due to the first letter of 1. 140, was detected by Nettleship who
proposed derigitum but ⁶ derigere ' seems to mean ‘ to make some-

The suspicions word in these variants and in the vulgate text is cunctas,
which is extremely seeble in itself, and necessitates our giving to sanguinis
the sense of ⁶ kindred ² which is without example, if we except a corrupt
passage in Phaedrus (Ι. 28. 10); Heinsius conjectured iuncti for it,
