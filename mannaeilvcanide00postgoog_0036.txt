THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xxx-i

night, with a small following of thirty horsemen who had fled to
the same place, he pursued his flight through the vale of Tempe,
till at last he reached the coast and, taking ship in a corn
transport for Lesbos, put the sea between himself and Pharsalia.
Au the way, we are told, he bewailed the great miscalculation‚
and his almost treacherous desertion by the very troops on
whom he had leaned for victoryl.

The spectacle which met the eyes of Caesar and his as-
tonished soldiers upon their entrance was such as had never
been seen before in a Roman camp. There were leafy arbours
for dining in, tents floored with fresh cut turf, others screened
with ivy to protect them from the sun, or wreathed with branches
of bay, vast quantities of silver plate set out with other prepara-
tions for the feast that was to celebrate the Pompeian victory,
and much besides that told of aristocratic luxury and the spirit
that precedes a fall2. Caesar has recorded his own feelings of
not unnatural indignation. ‘Such were the men’ he writes
‘ who charged with sels-indulgence Caesar's most wretched and
long-suffering army, which had always been in want of every-
thing for necessary use! There were darker features in the
scene3 and the sight of so many of his countrymen dead and
. dying around him recalled to him the fate which would have
followed upon his own defeat. ‘They would have it s0,' he

lend no support to Lucan’s highly coloured picture of the fidelity of
Larisa. It must not however be supposed to be a pure invention of the
poet's. The agreement of Valerius Maximus (l.c. 712 n.), even to verba]
concurrence, and in the main of Dio (42. α), indicates a common source.

¹ Caesar l.c. sup. Plutarch, Pomp. 73, adds a number of interesting
personal details about the ssight. Lucan’s brilliant analysis of the
fugitive's feelings deserves to be mentioned (V111 1 sqq.). In vu his
hero once off the scene, the poet parts company with history and devotes
himself to the congenial tasks of slandering Caesar and revelling, like
a ghoul, among the spectres and carcases os the slain.
