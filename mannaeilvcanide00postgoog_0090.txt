217 sqq. All our authorities .(Caesar B. C. 3. 88, Plutarch Pomp.
69, Appian 2. 76) agree that· Scipio commanded the Pompeian centre.
But they disagree about the wings. Plutarch says Pompey commanded
on the right but Appian Lentulus3 they agree in placing Domitius on
the left. Appian says Pompey with Afranius τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐφύλαττεν,
which may be true of Afranius, but in the case of Pompey is un·
doubtedly an error, due perhaps to his early retirement to the camp.
Caesar does not expressly say who commanded the wings but notes
that Pompey was on the left, ‘ in eo loco erat ipse Pompeius) All
we can conclude with certainty is that Domitius commanded one wing‚
and Pompey—in his absence, Lentulus—the other. Which these
were must be doubtful.

224. stag-na ‘the pools os the Enipeus' overflow.' Compare the
language of Livy 1. 4. 4 ⁴ super ripas Tiberis effusus lenibus stagnis nec
adiri usquam ad iusti cursum poterat amnis ' and further on with sicel
226 ‘ cum fluitantem alueum quo expositi erant pueri tenuis in sicco aqua
destituisset) This flood of the Enipeus is mentioned by the military
writer Frontinus Strat. 2. 3. 22 whose words confirm Lucan in other
respects ‘ dextro latere sexcentos equites propter flumen Emjpea quod et
alueo suo et alluuie regionem impedierat (cf. Cacsar’s words 88 impeditis
,ἤι’-τ) reliquum equitatum in sinistro cornu cum auxiliis omnibus
