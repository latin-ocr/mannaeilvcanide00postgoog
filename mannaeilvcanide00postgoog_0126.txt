NOTES. 83

784. donat ‘makes a present of,' ‘remits’; first of the penalty
which is not exacted, a use further developed by Lucan, e.g. vl 58 ‘et
ratibus longae flexus donare Maleae ’ (‘to save ships the doubling of
Malea'); then of the crime for which‘ the penalty is due, as 1x 144
‘superis haec crimina dono,' 1087 sq. ‘parcimus annis Ι donamus-que
nefas‚' and 850 below.

785. ingesta ‘ thrust upon his sleeping eyes' (57, 798). Compare
Statius' imitation Th. 7. 466 sq. ‘bacchatur utrisque Ι Tisiphone castris;
fratrem huic, fratrem ingerit illi, Ι aut utrique patrem.' vm 431 sqq.
‘non tibi cum primum gelidum transibis Araxen Ι umbra senis maesti
Scythicis confixa sagittis Ι ingeret has uoces.’

786. uiuente ‘still alive! After Pompey's death Caesar will suffer
more. ,

787. retexit ‘uncovered,' cf. Virg. Aen. 9. 461 ‘iam rebus luce
retectis‚' and other places in poetry.

788 sq. nulla. appears to be distributive, ‘no feature of the place,'
as in Verg. G. 1. 506 ‘tam multae scelerum sacies’ means ‘so many
forms of crime.' It may however be taken with H. as ‘not at all,’ cs.
25 n. reuocat...haerentes ‘recalls from lingering'3 for the part.
cf. 678, 732. propulsa, cf. 637.

791. sidentis ‘ sinking down’ seems intended to suggest the
absent pyre3 cs. Prop. 3 (4). 9. 37 ‘in cineres arcem sedisse repentes?
Then ln tabem will=‘non in cineres?

792. populos, cf. 634, 812. epulis, mere spite. Appian
tells uS‚ c. 81 fin„ that on the evening of the battle Caesar and his
men supped off a meal prepared for the Pompeians, which is likely
enough ς, cf. Introd. p. xxxii.

794. non eernere terra-m, i.e. to see every inch os ground covered
with corpseS.

795. clade, 651 n. For the next line see Crit. App.

797. furens belongs to inuidet3 see 33 n.

798. igne. The abl„ which in Quintilian’s time was the usual
construction, 9. 3. 1 ‘ut hac re inuidere, non, ut ueteres et Cicero
praecipue, hanc rem,' first appears in Livy 2. 40. 11 ‘non inuiderunt
laude sua mulieribus uiri Romani.’ It is very likely an imitation of the
Gk. gen. with φθονεῖν. nocenti. The sense appears to be that he
punishes the guilty gods by thrusting (785 n.) the carnage of Pharsalia
in their faces. Cf. Stat. Sila. α. 2. 84 ‘quae tibi Parthenopen derecto
limite ponti Ι ingerit ’ (forces N aples on your gaze).

800. consu-118, L. Aemilius Paullus. cannae, like Emathiam
