xxxvi HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

words of Strabo 9. p. 431 to have been at some distance from
the new town (now Fersala) which is usually meant where no
epithet is added 1.

The last historian of the Civil Wars, Col. Stoffel‚ fixes the
scene of the battle at the north-east angle of the Pharsalian
plain. The river Enipeus, now called the Little T clzz‘narli, which
flows nearly due'north till it reaches the pass of Velestin0‚ there
turns through a right angle and pursues a westerly course,
gradually bending to the north as it gets further into the plain.
On the western side of the mountain (M. K ama-'ja Akmet) whose
base it washes as it makes the turn, Col. Stoffel places the
camp and forts (castella) of Pompey‚ and supposes the battle to
have been fought about two miles to the west on the left, or south,
bank of the river. Caesar's camp he places about two miles
further to the west in the space between the river and a rocky
point called K rindir, a projection from M. K aradagh or the hin
immediately to the west of Pharsalus 2. Col. Stoffel's selection of
the arriere-plaine of Pharsalus, as the only site which satisfies the
military conditions³, rests on three identificationS.

1. The identification of the Enipeus of this battle as the
Little Tchiuarli. This is now generally accepted and appears
to be correct, though, as may be seen from Long³s History, v. p.
214 (compare Mr Perrin's article, pp. 175 sq.), there was some
confusion in the use of the name by ancient authors, Thus
Lucan speaking of it sayS, vl 373, ‘numquamque celer nisi
mixtus EnipeuS,’ which seems to be a pointed contradiction of

¹ The name ⁴ battle of Pharsa10s‚’ which Mommsen and others
employ, is accordingly to be avoided.

² This position is that apparently assigned by Appian c. 75 [ὁ
Πομπήιος] παρέτασσε τοὺς λοιποὺς ἐς τὸ μεταξὺ Φαρσάλου τε πόλεως καὶ

 

Ἐνιπέως ποταμοῦ. Appian appears to have confused Old with New ·

Pharsalus.
⁸ ‘ Pompee...occupa des hauteurs qui s’abaissaient en avant de son

front sous forme de longs versantS, sur la declivite': desquels il pouvait
deployer son artnee en bataille‚ de maniere ὲ se reserver tout l'avantage
en cas d’attaque‚’ vol. 11. p. 242.
