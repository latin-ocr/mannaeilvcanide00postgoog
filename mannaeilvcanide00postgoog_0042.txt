THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xxxvii

Ovid Met. 1. 579 ‘irrequietus Enipeus? Valerius Flaccus agrees
with Lucan 1. 357 ‘segnior Apidani uires ubi sentit Enipe’us!

11. The ‘ riuus quidam impeditis ripis' of Caesar, on which
Pompey's right wing tested, is identified with the Enipeus,
This is much more doubtful. It is true that the Enipeus has
difficult banks3 and that Frontinus as well as Lucan says
distinctly that Pompey's right wing rested on that river 3 and
that Appian also (l. c.) mentions the Enipeus in connexion
with the battle. But Merivale well says that to speak of the
principa] river of Thessaliotis as ‘riuus quidam' would be
“against Caesar’s1 and all correct usage.'' To which Col. Stoffel
can only reply that Caesar gives the name of riuus to the
Enipeus because ‘on the day of the battle this river had no more
water in it than a brook‚' thus unconsciously contradicting two
out of the three authorities on whom the identification is
based ².

ΙΙΙ. But what are we to say of the third identification?
The Pompeians made their last stand on a mountain beneath
which flowed a river (‘hunc montem flumen subluebat,' Caesar
e. 97. 4), and Col. Stoffel supposes this mountain to be the eastern
height of M. Karadja Ahmet, and this ‘river' to be the same
Enipeus which was a ‘ brook’ in c. 88, and whose course up the
valley Caesar, according to Col. Stoffel's map‚ had been following
all the time, being never half a mile away from its banks!

As Col. Stoffel's theory must be rejected, and as strategical
reasons imperatively forbid the assumption of a site in the open,
south of the Lz'ttle Teleinarlz3 it only remains to suppose that
Pompey's camp was somewhere on the range of hills to the
North of the plain, and that the battle was thus fought between
them and the river. If 1 do not mistake‚ these hills were not
examined for a site by Col. Stoffel, who speaks only of the
southern range, p. 242. Such a position would agree well with
the facts that Pompey entered the camp from the field of battle

pertinebant,’ cf. ib. 3⁴7. 1, 3, 4.
