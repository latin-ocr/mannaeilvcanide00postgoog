1. seg-nior, i.e. rising more tardily. Oceano. A preposition
would be added in prose, R. 1258, N. L. P. 149. The sun was slow
in obeying the call of destiny (εἱμαρμένη), the immutable chain of cause
and effect which in the Stoic *view govemed the universe. .

α. luctificus with numquam mag-is ‘ never more fraught with
mouming.’ See also Crit. App. Titan, used* only of the sun in
Lucan, except 1x 654 where ‘Atlanta’ is added. eontra, the sun
and planets being supposed to move in the opposite direction to that
in which the ether and the fixed stars revolved. Ovid Met. α. 72 sq.
(of the sun) ‘nitor in aduersum nec me, qui cetera, uincit Ι impetuS, et
rapido contrarius euehor orbi,’ so ManiliuS‚ the Stoic poet, 1. 258 sq.
‘ solemque—atque alia aduerso luctantia sidera mundo) contra is also
used of mounting up a fixed object (cf. ‘aduerso monte' uphill) as H.

5. attraxit ⁸ drew to himself! The Latin, having no middle
voice, often uses the active instead, without as well as with εις so ferre
means φέρειν ‘ bring' and φέρεσθαι ⁸ take.’ pabula. The Stoics
and other ancients taught that the sun was fed on watery vapours.
