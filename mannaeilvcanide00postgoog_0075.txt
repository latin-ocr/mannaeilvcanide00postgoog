According to Lucan on this occasion he desired not to feed but to

cloud his rayS.

&maman-unbem-
§.d Pompey’s theatre completed in 52 Rc, and known ·· as the
‘ stone theatre ’ could hold 4o,ooo spectatorS. Lucan, who is well
aware of Pompey’s vain passion for popularity (cf. 726), says pointedly
1 132 sq. ‘totus popularibus auris Ι impelli plausuque sui gaudere
theatri?

10. innumeram, a ‘transferred epithet ' belonging in sense to
plebis. effigiem properly a ‘ cast ' or ‘ model ’ (ef-fingo), then the
‘copy ' as opposed to the real thing and s0, as here, a ‘ phantom.’

12. Apparently an imitation of Virgil Georg. 2. 508 sqq.

14. prim, an anachronism. His first triumph was in Sept. 81
after he reduced Numidia. The Spanish triumph was 10 years later,
followed in 10 years again by the last of the three (685), the Mithridatic.

16. ruga-x ‘ runaway’ SertoriuS, in allusion to his guerilla
methods of warfare. inpulit ‘set in motion,' ‘ stirred up ’ς cf.
11 549 ‘ quique feros mouit Sertorius exul Hiberos ' and-718 sq.

17. Vespere, the lands of evening, the West‚ here Spain, cf. Sil.
It. 3. 32 5 sq. ‘ totus adest Vesper populique reposti; Ι Cantaber ante
omnis? pacato ‘ tranquillized‚' i.e. ‘ subjected‚’ a euphemism
apparently introduced by Julius Caesar and adopted in official language.
The British chiestain Calgacus says bitterly of the Romans ‘ ubi
solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant ' Tac. Agr. 30. pura. ‘ plain?
opposed to the purple-bordered logei (praetexta) of magistrates and the
embroidered toga picta worn at triumphs and referred to in the next
line. Both at his first and his second triumph Pompey was strictly a
priuatus, as he had held no civil office but was simply general, with the
titles of propraetor and proconsul on the two occasions respectively.

18. quam, cf. v 152, so after most words expressing comparison in

PlautuS, Livy etc., but Cicero and Caesar would use ac. currus,
the triumphal car3 so 280, Prop. 2. 14. 24, Juv, 8. 3 ‘stantes in
curribus Aemilianos.' The plur. is generic ‘ a triumphal car.’ or-

nante, i.e. quae ornat 359 n.
19. sou ‘whether it was that,' introducing three alternative
explanations, cf. 197 n. fine -bonorum ⁶ at the close of his

happiness,' compare vlu 29 ‘nisi summa dies cum fine bonorum Ι ad-
suit ' (again of Pompey).
