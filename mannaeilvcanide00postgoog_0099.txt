56 LVCANI DE BELLo c1v1L1 Lm. v11.

353. tatis ‘by a natural death’3 Virg. Aen. 4. 696 ‘quia nec sato
merita nec morte peribat ’ (and Henry’s note), or, as ovid sayS, ⁸ euntibus
ordine fatis' Her. 1. 101. potuero, as at NapleS‚ 34 n. The vanity
is true to lise ς cf. 378, 664. “

355. uincere, i.e. ensure victory.

357. sponte without sua is poetical and Silver Latin. sam-a, if
really referring to imagine, will mean belonging to the ‘ worshipped’ dead;
cf. Stat. Silu. α. 7. 116 (of Lucan himself) ‘tu magna sacer et superbus
umbra.’ Then antiquus must mean ‘ of the old school,’ ⁶ recalling
antiquity,’ a term os praise, but it seems at least equally probable that
Lucan has inverted the epithets and that antiqua imagine ‘ with
ancient marks' of ancient lineage is intended, much as in 11 244 sq.
he writes ‘tu mente labantem Ι ἅενιζξτ me, dubium certo tu robore firma‚’
when he would have done better to write labantem firma, dubium derige.
In this case compare for sacer 342· sacra...imagine is of course abl. of
description (241 n.). miles means they serve in the mults, cf. 87 n.

3 58. reduces, to be taken with all three names, which Lucan joins
again at vl 785 sqq. ⁴ uidi DeciOS, natumque patremque Ι lustrales
bellis animaS, flentemque Camillum Ι et Curios.’

359. uouentls, equivalent to a relative sentence or the Gk. part.
with the art„ a use much developed in Silver Latin, cf. Heitl. Introd.
p. 106, ‘currus ornante toga’ 18 n. :quae ornat, pulsans 608=quaepul-
sabat. It occurs earlier, e.g. Hor. Carm. 1. 34. 7 diuidem-

360. hino natent. cf. Hor. Carm. 3. 4. 58 ‘hinc auidus stetit
{Volcanus.' primo oriente. So ‘primis a Gadibus‚’ lx 414. Either
point is ‘ first ' or ‘furthest ' according to the way it is regarded.

362 sq. manus ‘bands’ as exciuere ‘called out’ shows.

363. comprensum, Crit. App. limite, the zodiac being
regarded as the sun’s path (cf. 867 n.)‚ Ov. Met. 2. 130 ‘sectus in
obliquo est lato curuamine limes-⁹

364. sub Noton ‘extending up to’ (so H. rightly); cs. x 48 ‘licet
usque sub Arcton Ι regnemus Zephyrique domos.' The Greek acc.
Noton (also v 542, 1x 539, 695, x 243) is not quoted from other
writers. hominum. For the partitive gen. cf. vul 812 ‘quid-
quid in Euro Ι regnorum Boreaque iacet.’ For numu: cf. 400.

365. supersum, pouring beyond them, outflanking them, super
..-=‘beyond‚’ as VIII 164 ‘mundi Ι arva super nimios soles Austrumque
iacentis,' and other places. The participle would mean more naturally
⁸ pouring over them‚’ as Livy 39. 49. 5 ‘iacentem hostes superfusi
oppresserunt.' conectam, forced into a small space, ‘penned in';
