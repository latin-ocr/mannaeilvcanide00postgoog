82 LVCANI DE BELLo CIVILI Lm. vn.

770. superam noctem ‘night in the upper world,’ opposed to
Stygia nocte 817. cf. v 627 sq. ‘non caeli nox illa fuit3 latet obsitus
aer Ι infernae pallore domus)

772. sibila and flammas allude to the snakes and torches of the
FurieS. infert ‘brings before him'; cs. Stat. Theb. 8. 627 ‘sponsum
unde mihi sopor intulit amens?'

773. terror-1³ imag-0 ‘phantom terror? Cf. for the gen. 1v 231
‘pro dira pudoris Ι foedera‚' and 179 (Crit. App.).

774. figuras, mere shapeS, ‘spectreS‚’ so Lucu, Virg. Contrast
vl 660 ‘iam noua, iam uera reddetur uita figura!

77 5. cadauera, the empse, i-e. the phantom which the Romans did
not clearly distinguish from it. The shade has all the wounds and
marks of the body. Lucan uses plur. for sing. as well as sing. for plur.
(102 n.); cf. 408, 440, compare also 711 n. populus and populi are
particularly difficult to discriminate.

776. From in twice repeated we may see Lucan’s idea is not that
os haunting, but of possession.

777. scymea, at the altar of the Tauric Artemis 3 see EuripideS,
Iphigenia in Tauris.

778. Pelopeus, when applied to members of the family, appears
generally to connote crime or disaster. So Prop. 4 (5). 6. 33, Ov. Tr.

4 477697. attonitos, 134 n. ammi. tumultus, cf. mentis tumultu

183; ‘miseros tumultus Ι mentis' Hor. Carm. 2. 16. 10 sq.

780. For Pentheus’ iUusions see Eur. Bacch. 918 sqq., and for
Agave’s awakening from her madness ib. 1264 sqq. Compare the
imitation in Stat. T heb. 3. 189 sq. ‘cum lassa furorem Ι uicit, et ad
comitum lacrimas expauit Agaue.' .

782. ultrix...dlos ‘the day of vengeance’ ς cf. Sil. It. 2. 495
‘statque dies ausis olim tam tristibus ultor.’ uisura.. The omission
of est with the fut. part. is very rare. It occurs however in Prop. 1. 19.
18 (perhaps 8. 37) and at least five times in claudian. eramento,
sc. eos, ‘when the senate unsheathes.'

783. premunt ‘ pursue him,' cf. 773. flagellant. The idea
of scourging is frequent in descriptions of the torments os a guilty
conscience3 cs. Lucr. 3. 1019 sq. ‘at mens sibi conscia facti (cf. the
next verse) Ι praemetuens adhibet stimulos terretque Ι flagellis‚’ [Quint]
decl. 12 ἓ 28 ‘ meum sane conscientia urunt animum intus scelerum faces,
et quotiens facta reputaui, flagella mentis sonant, ultrices uideo furias
(=infira monstra).’ See also JuV. 13. 193 sqq. (with Mayor’s notes).
