THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xxvii

concealed from their sightl. He gave them the necessary
instructionS, and told them that on their valour depended the
fortunes of the day. At the same time he warned the third line
and the army generally not to engage the enemy until he
hoisted the scarlet flag2. In accordance with military custom
he then addressed his army in a brief harangue³. He reminded
thern of his constant care for their welfare, and, recapitulating
all the offers that he had made to his adversaries, he appealed
to them to say if he had not made every effort in the cause
of peace. ‘ 1‚’ he concluded‚ ‘have never desired to waste
my soldiers' blood or to rob our country of either of its
armies.' For answer rose a loud and vehement cry for battle,
and Caesar bade the trumpet sound⁴. At this moment
occurred an incident which throws a vivid light on the ardour
of the Caesarians and their devotion to their leader. As
Caesar passed along the lines, Gaius CrastinuS, an euocatus,
formerly an officer in the tenth legion and one os his most

near him. ‘ Comrades in my former company,' he said, ‘follow

·¹ See besides Caesar (89. 4, 93. 5). Frontinus l.c. ‘sex deinde
cohortes in subsidio retinuit ad res subitas», sed dextro latere conuersas in
obliquum, unde equitatum hostium expectabat ⁹ (cf. obliquas Lucan
522); Plutarch, Pomp. 69 μετεπέμψατο σπείρας ἐξ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπιταγμάτων
καὶ κατέστησεν ὄπισθεν τοῦ δεκάτου κελεύσας ἡσυχίαν ἄγειν ἀδήλους τοῖς
πολεμίοις ὄντας.

² ‘uexillo' Caes· c. 89. 5. Plutarch Pomp. 68 also mentions the
φοινικοῦν χιτῶνα, but makes it exhibited before the Caesarians left the
camp. Dr Gow suggests that it was used to give the signal to the
reserve.

⁸ See Caesar c. 90. Pompey would address his troops at the same
time ς but we have no authentic report of what he said, cf. above,
p. x, n. 2.

⁴ The signal would be taken up by the other military instrumenta,
cf. Lucan 47 5 sqq„ and Caesar c. 92. 4 ‘ signa undique concinerent.'
