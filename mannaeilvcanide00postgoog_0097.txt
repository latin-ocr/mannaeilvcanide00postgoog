them (318 sq.) but to slaughter the auxiliaries (275 sqq.) in order to
inspire the Romans with terror. 1 have however changed the punctua-
tion (ef. Crit. App.) because 323 sqq. refer to Romans and so belong
to 322. It is absurd to say ‘whether he is going to attack a kinsman
or not, let him count the killing of an alien enemy a crime.’ Mistake
has arisen through its not being observed that aino—sou as usual, cs. 19,
197 n.‚ follow the clause to which they refer and that Lucan having
used the indefinite quis does not go back to the second person, imputate
as it would be, but continues with the metrically convenient third.

Cf ἓξὲξ sqq. Here again Lucan and Appian (2. 74 καθέλετέ μοι προιόντες

ἐπὶ τὴν μάχην τὰ τείχη τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν τάφρον ἐγχώσατε)
are in striking agreement, no one else mentioning this order of Caesar.
Tbeir account is contradicted by Caesar' s own statement 3. 89‘ cohortes
vn (11 Mss) castris praesidio reliquerat'; and it is, as Μι Β. Perrin
American Joum. qf Philology vol. v pp. 32 5 sqq. has shown, most im·
probable. Appian, he thinks, derived it from Lucan. Cf.1ntrod.

7. 53 ‘plenis iam nubilis annis’ (of fuu age). Appian gives different
reasons for the order, of which one is quoted below. non sparsa,
i.e. in a solid array3 cf. x 436 (on 337 below).

328. no, Crit. App. castris ‘ quarters,’ practically=tentotiis,
cf. tendetis διο. tendetis. The regular word for encamping,
not avoided by poets. For the sense cf. Appian 1. c. 1να...οῑ πολέμιοι...
συνῶσιν ὅτι πρὸς ἀνάγκης ἐστὶν ἡμῖν ἐν rot: ἐκείνων σταθμεῦσαι.

330. trahit well expresses the discipline of Caesar's troops3 each
soldier's duty draws him mechanically. raptim, so Caesar c. 85
‘ confistimque expeditas copias educit.'

331. ceres. The usual custom before a battle, so Vegetius 3. c. 11
‘ ueteribus saeculis mos suit parco cibo curatos milites ad certamen
educere,’ cf. Val. F l. 5. 215 sq. ⁸ dona dehinc Bacchi casusque ut firmet
in omnes Ι rapta Ceres? But the hardened veterans os Caesar, who had
not long had a meai—they were on the point of setting out as Caesar
says l. ο.. the signal had been given for departure and the tents were
struck (detensis tabernaculis, which by the way may have given rise to
the story of the dismantling os the camp)—would hardly have wanted a
second resreshment. capiunt, i.e. the omen in Caesar’s last words3
