CRrrICAL APPENDIX. ’95

n(oscere) are matter of doubt3 (4) that there is hopeless disagreement
about the end of the line. There are four wordS, uultus, tempus, possent,
quaerunt competing for two places· quaerunt is now rejected by all,
and rightly so ε it is clearly an attempt to provide a governing verb for
the infinitive. tempus again, as Dr Hosius and Mr Heitland agree, is
undoubtedly genuine. Of the two words left, possent may well have
been interpolated for the same reason as quaerunt, while uultus does
not appear to be due to agnoscere, as it occurs in P. uultus again gives
a touch which Lucan is not likely to have omitted (cf. 322, 1v 170). Ι
think then the variants are best explained by the hypothesis that the
end of 462 was injured in the archetype and its last word tempus was
written in again in a place where it might be thought to refer to uultus,
one scribe accordingly taking uultus and another tempus from the supposed
alternatives and each filling up the line according to his fancy, the
difficulty of the real construction ‘noscere uoltus ac (noscere) quae
monstra facturi forent' (cf. 375 n.) preventing thern from seeing the truth.
As QVE is written Q. in early MSS, ·que agnoscere and quo noscere
could easily come from Q.ACNOSCERE (ac noscere which Oudendorp
conjectured). The resulting reading will be inde manum spectant 3
uultusque aemoscere tempus. The disagreement about the order of
the lines may mean that one of them (which must be 463, where too it
may be observed that aut is not correctly used) is spurious. Then we
shall read and punctuate inde manus spectant uultusque, ac noscere
tempus. 488-521 PMGV have these verses in the order of the numbers
which, however, as Dr Hosius and Mr Heitland contend, cannot be
correct. They adopt the order of U and with slight difference of BE,
488, 510-520‚ 489—5o9‚ 521. 1 prefer that, of C 488, 514-520, 489-
513, 521: for (ι) it is not like Lucan to mention the light-armed
without any description of them3 (2) there is no close connexion
between 488 and „uo-513, while there is a close connexion between
· 488 and 514 sqq. tunc et ‘then even the Ituraeans ' 3 (3) illic (510) has no
special point following 488, whereas after 509 it indicates belli per ultima
and per extremos—maniplo53 (4) we now understand the transpositions3
someone observed that light-armed (archers) were mentioned in 514—
520 and also in 510-513 and put a mark against each of the passage&
in consequence of which subsequent copyists brought the passages
together, some by moving 514—520 and others by moving 510-513.
