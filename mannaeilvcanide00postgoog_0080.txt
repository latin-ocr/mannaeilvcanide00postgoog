91. vernem, imperfect, because of accepisse which, as the perfect
proper, may take a secondary tense. Compare Q. Cicero 4. 13 ‘ quae
subsidia haberes et habere posses exposui ’ (though in Eng. we say ‘ 1
have set out what aids you have and can have ’), and Ν. L. P. 229,
389 (α). The student should observe that the present testor has no
power to alter the sequence of the verbs depending on the perf. inf.
92. accepisse ‘have had it imposed upon me’ as terms (cf. leges
acctpere) are imposed on the conquered.
93. utare, cf. 111 381 ‘tum res immenso placuit statura labore!
labor is very common in connexion with bellum, no doubt from

 

the exceedingly toilsome character of Roman warfare; so even without
bellum Tib. ι. ι. 3 ‘quem labor assiduus uicino terreat hoste,‘ Prop.
4 (5). 1. 139. sine caede to be taken with captiuum as well as
subactum.

94. tradere, for punishment. Caesar knew (as well as Pompey
cf. vul 10 sqq. ‘ seque memor fati tantae mercedis habere Ι credit adhuc
iugulum quantum pro Caesaris ipse Ι auolsa ceruice daret ’) what was in
store for him if defeated (394 sqq.).

95. melorum with furor ‘guilty madness) See also crit. App.

96. metuunt. The Schol. notices the change of person as
intentional‚ cf. 109 ιι.

97. terras opposed to aequore. Pompey’s fleet commanded the
sea. The Schol. quotes Virg. Aen. 9. 13¹ sq. ‘rerum pars altera
adempta est3 Ι terra autem in manibus nostris)

98. praematuras ‘unripe.’ Caesar says of himself B. C. 3. 8ι
⁸ idoneum locum in agris nactus quo prope iam matura erant frumenta'
that is a few days (ib. 82) before Pompey's arrival in Thessaly.

99 sq. The expression is somewhat redundant. We could dispense
either with uotum or ut manet. ⁴

100. ghaun, i.e. nonsame3 cf. ieiaema 98.

101.meis,i.e. meorum; perhaps a compendious comparison
(28 n.;) but cf. 652 ιι. For the idea cf. 655.

ς 192. his, neuter‘ by the measuresJ ne, cf. 406 n. uro,
sing. for plur. as 758 and 838 uictor, 402 fissore, 293 augure and
mens, 294 corpus, 598 and 839 cadauer, 829 sunere, 834 uoltum, 837
alite. So probably Cyclops ι59. Pompey takes just credit to himself
for training his raw levies3 compare Introd. p. xviii.

103. itae, of martial ardour; frequent in Lucan, e.g. 111 614 ‘creuit
in aduersis uirtus3 plus nobilis irae Ι truncus habet: ιν 267, 553 3 124,
386 inf.; Cic. Acad. 2. ἓ 135 ‘ipsam iracundiam fortitudine& quasi
