our authorities are agreed that no single Roman was killed
except with arms in his handsl. The bodies of the Caesarians
were religiously interred by their comrades. But the Pom-
peian dead were left on the field ⁸. No military or political
considerations required their interment‚ and there was no moral
obligation upon an ancient commander to give sepulture to a
fallen soe; and though it may have shocked a Roman patriot to
think that so many of his countrymen were left as prey to the
wolves and vultures of Thessaly, the Civil wars had long passed
out of the region of sentiment³.

Os the historical importance of Pharsalia it is unnecessary to
speak at length. It has not indeed the thrilling interest of those
conflicts in which the victors have been in serious jeopardy. In
the harbour of Alexandria the life of Caesar was in far greater
peril ; at Munda his fortunes hung upon a thread. But though

¹ Excluding Dio CassiuS, who says that Caesar executed all the
senators and equites, whose lives he had spared on previous occasions
(41. 62). Merivale quotes against him, besides Caesar B. C. 3. 98,
Cicero pro Marcello c. 3, pro Ligario c. 6 ⁸ quis non earn uictoriam probet
in qua occiderit nemo nisi armatus ?' Velleius α. 52, Suet. Iul. 75,
Florus 4. α. 90 (speaking generally). Caesar might certainly have been
excused for some severity after the insolent ferocity of Labienus (B. C.
3. 71. 4), but there is no reason for doubting the truth of his own
statement.

² The fact is given by Lucan (788 sqq.) who finds in it an ex-
cellent handle sor declamation· against Caesar.

³ On the reasons for Caesar's different conduct after the defeat of the
Helvetii (B. G. 1. 26), see Col. Stoffel (vol. 11. p. ²51)· Hannibal's
‘burying of the consul’ (Lucan 800) after Cannae if really a fact (Livy
αα. 52. 6 does not commit himself, ‘consulem quoque Romanum con·
quisitum sepultumque quidam auctores sunt ’) was a tn‘bute which,
as it is said, he paid or desired to pay to the other gallant foeS, Gracchus
(Livy 25. 17. 4), Flaminius (ib. 22. 7. 5, a passage worth quoting as
a comment upon Lucan’s attack on Caesar: ‘ Hannibal—segregata ex
hostium coaceruatorum cumulis corpora, suorum curn sepeliri iussisset,

Flamini quoque corpus funeris causa magna cum cura inquisitum non
inuenit’). And at Cannae Silius Italicus, ro. 521 sqq„ mentions only the
buming of the Carthaginian dead and of the Roman Consul.
