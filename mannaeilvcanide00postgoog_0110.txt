1 72 ‘nec se Roma ferens’=et R. se non-serens) nor in <flu which he
defends by vm 672 sq. ⁸ nodosaque frangit Ι ossa diu? With uertens
however, which indicates an essentially momentary action, this adverb is
not appropriate; and a comparison of 111 337 sq. ‘ non pondera rerum!
nec momenta sumusss suggests that rerum tot pondera should refer to
what was of importauce in deciding the issues at stake. Some con-
jectures are given in the crit. App.

505. fato torrente. The metaphor is apparently from a river in
flood. The sole difference between fortune and sate in this and other
places of Lucan appears to be that indicated by the capital letter. cf.
88 sq., 205 sq„ 111 392, v1u 21 sqq,

506. Lucan apparently misled by the fact that there were a few
horse on the right wing (Frontinus quoted on 224) wrongly regards
both Pompeian wings as participating i'n the outflanking movement
which was to turn the battle. See Caesar’s account 0. 88 fin. ‘ dextrum
cornu eius (Pompey) riuus quidam impeditis ripis muniebat: quam ob
caussam cunctum equitatum sagittambs fhnditoresque omnes iu sinistro
cornu obiecerat.'' For diduxit cornua„ ‘ drew the wings in different
directions,' compare Livy “z-8. 14. 15 and 17· “nuntium (Scipio) ad
Silanum et Marcium misit ut cornu extenderent in sinistram partem
quemadmodum. se tendentem ad dexteram uidissent.—-ita diductis· cor-

n ’bus ’ etc.
t 507. bess-1, cf. ιη, 651 n. ultima, Caesar's extreme right

508. sparsa, of the free order of light armed. per extremm
...mammea i.e. over Pompey’s extreme left and right.

509. insequitur, cf. Caesar c. 93, ‘ eodem tempore equites ab
sinistro Pompei cornu, ut er'at imperatum, universi procucurrerunt omnis-
que multitudo sagittariorum se profudit, quorum impetum noster equi·
tatus non tulit, sed paullum loco motus cessit, equitesque Pompeiani hoc
acrius instare et se turmatim explicare aciemque nostram a latere aperto
circumire coeperunt.' ’ saeuas ‘bloodthirsty bands‚' see Crit. App.

511. eunom, dat. inde...1.nde, cf. 230 sq.

5 1 2. meos. These, like the saxa, would be hurled from ballistae, cf.
11 686 sq. ‘ tortaque per tenebras validis ballzssita lacertis Ι multifidas
iaculata faces) But it is not clear what they are doing here where there
are no ships or buildings to fire. It looks as if Virgil Aen. 1. 150
‘iamque faces et saxa uolant,’ were being copied without reflection. In
Val. Fl. 3. 96 ‘saxa facesque atras et tortae pondera fiandae' are the
weapons of a mob.
