60 LVCANI DE BELLo CIV1L1 LIB. vn.

406. oo ne ‘to such a point of ruin that...not.' So Mr Parry
takes the passage, which is generally misunderstood. The consecutive
sense of ne, which was developed out of the final sense, is extremely rare
unless a verb like efficio precede (N. L. P. 393, 455) and the action
may be regarded as purposed as well as resulting. But see Tac. Ann.
14. 7 ‘at Neroni, nuntios patrati facinoris opperienti, adfertur euasisse
leui ictu sauciam et hactenus adito discrimine ne auctor dubitaretur-⁸
The use here however is stranger. corpore, Crit. App.

408. nomina, perhaps plur. because Cannae is plur., but see 775 n.

410 sq. timuit. The 18th of July was marked in the Calendar
as the dies Alliensir. It does not appear however that the date of
Cannae, Aug. 2nd, was similarly marked. And the statement that Rome
‘ chose to ignore’ (nescire) Pharsalia is untrue‚ as it is marked as a
victory in the Fasti Amiternini and the Fasti Antiates and was pro·
bably so marked in the Fasti A llifizni.

411. pro monetata, so in v 57, vt 305.

412. tractu. For trahere of ‘inhaling’ cf. Ov. Met. α. 230
‘feruentisque auras, uelut e fornace profund0‚ Ι ore trahit! fluentis
‘spreading’ of the imperceptible dis-fusion of plague-seeds through the
air by the aura fluens (cf. vlu 247). H. well refers to vl 89, ‘traxit
iners caelum flut'dae contagia pestis Ι obscuram in nubem ’ with which
compare Lucr. 6. 922 sqq. and 1 120.

413. insanam ‘maddening.’ Cf. Shakespeare Macheth 1 3 ‘the
imane herb that takes the reason prisoner '3 H. cf. ‘ uaesana sames’ Virg.
Aen. 9. 340. permissas ‘abandoned,’ ‘surrendered.’ v 694 sq.
‘ mundi iam summa tenentem Ι permisisse mari.' Cf. 731 n.

414. latu-ros. To see in the fut. part. a reference to the imaginary
supposition contained in ‘possent ’ gives an insipid sense; and the
fut. part. in poets often appears to differ little from a present, e-g.
Enn. dub. 7 ‘carbasus alta uolat, pandam ductura carinam.’ plena,
Crit. App.

415. explere, i.e. fill the gaps made by these disasterS, 387 n.

417. expneat, cf. 201 n. eripiens ‘ while snatching them
away.’ The sense is that differently expressed by Manilius 2. 8 ‘patriae
qui iura petenti, Ι dum dabat, crepuit?

419. quam magna. cadas ‘what greatness falls with thee.’ ‘ How
„ great thou art in thy sall ' hardly hits the meaning of the Latin. Scott
Marmion canto 11 st. 28 ‘ How salse the charge, how true he fill, Ι This

guilty packet best can tell!
420. possemt...cucurrtt. The somewhat abrupt change to the third
