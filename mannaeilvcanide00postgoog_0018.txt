THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xiii

There appear good grounds for believing that one, and perhaps
the chief, of these was the now lost history of Livy. More than
one incident, of which Lucan is now the earliest witness, is
said to have been recorded in Livy, e.g. that of the Augur
Cornelius 1. A predecessor of Lucan, Valerius Maximus, the ’
industrious collector of anecdotes, used Livy and refers to
him 3 and there are some striking agreements between Lucan
and Valerius Maximus-². A succeeding historian, L. Annaeus
Florus, drew chiefly from Livy-‘³3 and Lucan and Florus are
often in the closest agreement4. Lucan again must have
been· naturally drawn to a writer whose treatment of the
aristocrats was so ‘Pompeian⁶.' Nor is it superfluous to
observe that the frequency with which Livy may be used for
the illustration of Lucan’s phraseology points of itself to the
same conclusion⁶.

So far as 1 know, no evidence is forthcoming that Lucan did
actually draw from any other source. There is nothing to show
that he used the lost history of Asinius Polli0‚ and if within the
present book he made any use of the narrative of Caesar, it was
certainly only for the purpose of contradicting it.

⁸ His history is called an epitome of Livy3 see Teuffel's History qs
Roman Literature‚ ed. 2, ἓ 348 notes 1 and 2.

⁴ It has been sought to explain these agreements by the hypothesis
that Florus copied Lucan. That Florus had read the ⁸ Civil War,’
that for ideas and expressions he is often indebted to its author, may
well be admitted. But to suppose thatin questions of fact the epito-
mator of a history would abandon its statements for those of a poem
written more than a century after the events is an imputation of
incompetence not admissible without the strictest proof. The same
may be said of Appian.

⁸ Tac. A nn. 4. 34 ‘ T. Liuius—Cn. Pompeium tantis laudibus tulit
ut Pompeianum eum Augustus appellaret! Compare on the whole
question Mr Heitland, Introduction, p. 127.
