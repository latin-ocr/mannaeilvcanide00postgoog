THE BA‘r‘rLE OF PHARSALIA. xxix

the sig-n for his cavalry to move, and from the lest wing a
dense mass of over six thousand projected itself upon the
thousand horsemen of Caesar. The weight of the attack
was irresistible, and the Caesarians gradually feu back. The
hostile cavalry, their first object accomplished, spread out in
looser formation, and rode in squadronS, to take the defenceless
legionaries in flank and rearl. The whole force of slingers
and bowmen followed them. That instant Caesar gave the
signal to his reserves; and six cohortS, with weapons levelled at
their enemies’ faces, furiously charged the advancing horse2.
The effect of this apparition was instantaneous. The horse·
men hardly waited to be attacked, but fied in ludicrous panic
to the tops of the adjacent hills. The light-armed troops were
now without protection and were slaughtered to a man ³. For
Caesar’s clemency did not extend to foreigners.

An effort might yet have restored the day. For the
ranks of the Pompeian legionaries were still unbroken, and
their numbers still in a great preponderance. But Pompey
could not make it. He had staked everything on a single
throw, and his spirit was crushed. At once he rode from the

loud voice, for all to hear, he called to the centurions there on

(Florus l.c. on 319) seems specially to refer. It is expressly assigned
to it by Plutarch Caes. 45, Pomp. 71, and Appian c. 78, cf. Long Hist.

³ By Caesar’s oevalry and auxiliaries, it would appear, the six
cohorts having other work in hand. It is quite clear that Caesar's
famous order parce ciuibus (Florus Le. on 319, Suet. Iul. 75 ‘acie
Pharsalica proclamauit ut parceretur ciuibus,' Polyaen. Strat. 8. 23,
29 φείδεσθε τῶν πολιτῶν (so we should read), Appian c. 80 ἀψαυστεῖν

what elaborate instructions which Appian inserts in Caesar’s speech,
