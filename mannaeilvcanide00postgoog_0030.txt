THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. XXV

lest, where there was open ground for every evolution, were
posted the cavalry and the light-armed. Of the auxiliaries the
Macedonian, Peloponnesian‚ Boeotian and Athenian hoplites
alone were placed in a line with the legionaries; the rest,
arrayed according to their tribes, were stationed apart, with
orders to wait till the battle was decided‚ to join in the pursuit
and to seize the hostile camp ¹. His dispositions made, Pompey
awaited the approach of the enemy.

When Caesar sailed to draw his opponent into an engage-
ment, he changed his plan of campaign. He resolved to break
up his present camp, and, by continually moving from place
to place, to secure his own supplies, to wear out the Pom-
peians who in marching powers were much inferior to his
own veterans, and to watch for every opportunity of striking a
b10w2.

The change was to be made that very morning. The signal
for departure had been given, the tents were struck⁸‚ the line of
march was already defiling through the gates of the camp, when
his scouts brought in the intelligence that Pompey was offering the
battle which he had so long declined4. Caesar did not hesitate.
Telling his troops that they had not now to march but to sight,
and that the long wished-foropportunity was ⁸corne at last and
might not soon return, he drew them out in fighting order with-
out an instant’s delay⁶. Leaving seven cohortsss, or about 3‚ooo

may be doubted whether it should be altered to VI or vn. Appian
