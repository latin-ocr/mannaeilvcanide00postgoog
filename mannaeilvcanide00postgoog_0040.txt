THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. XXXV

Caesar might have fallen, Caesarism had triumphed. For
Pharsalia, revealing the political impotence of the oligarchy as
clearly as it revealed the military inferiority of their only
commander‚ had written in unmistakable characters upon the
walls of the tottering Roman commonwealth the message of
fate,

οὐκ ἀγαθὸν πολυκοιρανίη· εἷς κοίρανος ἔστω.

Pharsalia, though excluded from the catalogue of Sir Edward
Creasy‚ may fairly claim-to have witnessed one of the decisive
battles of the world. It has a better title to this honour than
the Macedonian flats with which, in despite of geography, it
became inseparably associated in the popular imagination,
where the leaders of the conscientious assassins fell before the
remorseless eagles of the Avenger; and one at least as good
as the Ambracian roadstead, where the conflict of the mad
ambition of Antony and the cold ambition of Octavian was
grafted on the eternal antagonism of East and West.
