the current account, that they settled on the altar αὐτῷ’ δὲ τῷ Πομπηίῳ
τῆς αὐτῆς νυκτός τινα τῶν ἱερείων οὐ συνελήφθη καὶ μελισσῶν ἐσμὸς ἐπὶ
τοῖς βωμοῖς ἐκάθισε, ζὶρου νωλεχοΰς.

162. 'malon ‘bowed down with the unusual (or overpowering)
weight.’ The abl. in i· in comparative stems is extremely rare and,
excepting prtbri Ov. Met. 8. 443 (a doubtful case), is not found in
the best period. The other example in Lucan is priori lx 996.
As is well known, it is usually the forms os the consonantal stems that
supplant those of the i stems, not vice versa.

163. mersere ‘caused to sink,' ‘bowed down' ς cf. Sil. It. 1ο. 78 sq.

· (of a dog snuffing along the ground) ‘erroresque ferae sollers per deuia

- mersa Ι nare legit.’ rorantia fietu. Statuoe are said to have
wept, e.g. at Julius Caesar's fate, Virg. G. 1. 480, ov. Met. 15. 792
and before Cannae, Sil. It. 8. 64 5, but ensigns perhaps only here.
Some sort of personality seems to have been attributed to them, as
Pliny tells us that the ‘aquilae ac signa' were anointed with persumes on
feast days, adding sarcastically ‘ita est nimirum hac mercede corruptae
orbem terrarum deuicere aquilae.' Propertius 4 (5). 1. 96 ‘ concidit
ante aquilae rostra cruenta suae’ perhaps intends to suggest a similar
idea.

164. publica ⁸ of the state.' After Pharsalia they were Caesar’s,
i. e. pn’uata3 cf. 11 319 sq. ⁴ quin publica signa ducemque Ι Pompeium
sequimur?’ ib. 532 sq. ⁸-o uere Romana manuS, quibus arma senatus Ι
non priuata dedit!

165. admotus super-1⁸ ⁸ brought into the presence of the gods.⁸

memsa- ‘ The altar would be of turs or stones.
166. mathim, 872 n. The ‘ fuga uictimarum’ is mentioued also

by Val. Max„ FloruS, Appian ll.c. above. praecem, adverb.
praecipitem would be more usual in prose.

167. funestis, as the army was doomed.

“ 168. scelerum superos ‘gods that prompt to crimes'; cf. 11 80
⁸ terribilesque deos scelerum,’ e. g. Mars, one of whose attendants is
‘caecum NefaS,' Stat. T h. 7. 48.

170. Nefas personified, as in vx 695 and Stat. supr. ‘Fas’ was
addressed by the setials in declaring war, Livy 1. 32. 6. Similar
personified abstractions abounded in the Roman pantheon. So
mores ‘ Frenzies' for which cf. Stat. Theb. 9. 832 sq. ‘BelltPotens cui
sola uagum per inane ruenti Ι Ira comes, reliqui sudant ad bella
Furores.’ -

171. litanti, opposed to Pompey's unsuccessful sacrifice.
