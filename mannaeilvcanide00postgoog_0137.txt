94 LVCANI-‘DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII.

414 plena MSS, plana Bentley. The MS reading seems however to
be sufficiently supported by ‘plena—urbe' v 33, ‘pleno litore’ vlu
309. The inhabitants are supposed to have flocked to the city walls
(cf. 369). If any change be needed, prona, also confused with plena,
would agree better with, in praeceps. Cf. Claud. in Eutrop. 2. 27 sq.
‘tremor Calchedona mouit Ι pronus! 419 quo edd„ quam Ml,
quae the rest. 421 omnibus annis MVBG; omnibus armis, EUC
HosiuS, would echo omne bellum in the same line. The antithesis of
dies—annis seems decisive for the former. One day destroyed the work
of all the years. 436 sqq. Ausoniam—nostris uolturis ed., Au·
soniam‚-nostris ,· uolturis the vulgate. With the latter punctuation
uellem has to be taken in a sort of parenthesis with incognita (fem. sing.)
‘liberty which I could wish had been unknown’ and seruis-sas as=
‘seruire debebas’ (cf. 646 n.). uellem however never seems to be so
used (though ‘ utinam ’ is in Tib. 1. 3. α), and a feeble line is produced.
450 Mimantis Parrhasius, minantis (or ·es) the MSS. 452 in-
tulit MBE, inpulit UVGC. With Mr Heitland Ι prefer the former
‘ brought the stars in upon Thyestes! He says “ the sense will be very
like vl 742-4. tibi...inmittam ruptis Titana cauernis Ι et subito feriere
die.” 462-3· A well-known crux. P (see above, p. 89) VU (origin-
ally it would appear ; both lines are over erasures) have the order 463,
4623 and so lactantius Placidus the commentator on StatiuS, our oldest
authority except Ρ (he does not quote 462 at all). The order 462, 463
is given by MBE. G omits 462 which is added by g. Internal con-
siderations lead me to assent to Mr Heitland who recommends the
order of the older witnesses. Coming to other differenceS, we must
regret that P has lost the end of 462 having only va‘rvs Qvo No (we may
supply semum but the rest cannot be conjectured) and that the readings
of M are not certain. The following are the variants in 462:

manum PV Lact. tempus (ἲ Μ) VC Lact.
{manus EU (see above) gv uultus PBEUg }

maniis B before an erasure1

quo noscere (? Μ) VP Lact. possent (·int Lact.) (ἲ) MVe
{que agnoscere BEUg quaerunt BEUg }

In 463 U has qua for quam3 but the MSS otherwise agree. 1t
thus appears (1) that manum is better supported than manus which
however has some authority3 (2) that uultus and tempus are well
supported, the former more strongly3 (3) that the letters between qu and
